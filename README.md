Smart Assistive System for Dementia Patients

An intelligent assistive system designed to help Alzheimerâ€™s patients by using face recognition for identifying frequent visitors, real-time GPS tracking, and an SOS emergency alert system for caregivers.

Features

Face Recognition for Identifying Visitors â€“ Helps patients recognize known individuals by identifying frequently visiting people.

Real-Time GPS Tracking â€“ Fetches live location data from the Neo-6M GPS module to track the userâ€™s position.

SOS Emergency Alert System â€“ Sends an emergency alert with GPS coordinates via SMS to a designated caregiver.

Twilio SMS Integration â€“ Uses the Twilio API to send instant alerts.

Raspberry Pi Compatibility â€“ Works on Raspberry Pi 4B, with remappable GPIO pins for flexibility.

User-Friendly GUI â€“ A simple Tkinter-based interface featuring an SOS button for emergencies.

Customizable Caregiver Contact â€“ Allows modification of the recipientâ€™s phone number.

Secure Face Recognition Data â€“ Maintains a database of known faces for accurate identification.

Error Handling & Debugging â€“ Displays errors using Tkinter message boxes for easy troubleshooting.

Portable & Expandable â€“ Can be integrated into wearable or IoT devices and expanded with voice alerts or cloud integration.

Installation & Setup

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

2. Install Dependencies

pip install opencv-python numpy twilio pigpio

Ensure you have OpenCV, NumPy, Twilio, and PiGPIO installed for the face recognition and GPS tracking features.

3. Enable Raspberry Pi Serial Interface

Enable the UART interface for GPS communication:

sudo raspi-config

Go to Interfacing Options > Serial

Disable login shell access, but enable serial hardware

Reboot the Raspberry Pi


sudo reboot

4. Start PiGPIO Daemon

sudo pigpiod

5. Run the Smart Assistive System

python3 main.py

Face Recognition Setup

1. Collect Face Data

Run the face data collection script (face_dataset.py) to store known faces.



2. Train the Model

Use face_training.py to train the system on collected images.



3. Run the Recognition System

Start face_recognition.py to identify visitors.
